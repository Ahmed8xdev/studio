## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 80%, 40%) - RGB(20, 115, 199) A vibrant blue to convey trust and innovation.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 20%) - RGB(51, 61, 77) A dark background enhances content visibility.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 50%) - RGB(64, 191, 191) A bright cyan for interactive elements and highlights, drawing attention without overwhelming the design.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clean lines and readability, ideal for both headings and body text.
- Implement a modern, minimalist layout with generous spacing and clear content hierarchy to guide the user’s eye and ensure effortless navigation.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations such as fade-in effects and parallax scrolling in the hero section to add depth and dynamism, creating a polished user experience.
- Use a set of consistent, modern icons, particularly in the services section. The icons should complement the minimalist design and be animated subtly on hover to enhance interactivity.
